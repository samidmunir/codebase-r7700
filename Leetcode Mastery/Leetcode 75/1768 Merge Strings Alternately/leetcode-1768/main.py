    - 1768. Merge Strings Alternately *EASY* (Python)

    You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

    Return the merged string.

    Example 1:
        Input: word1 = 'abc', word2 = 'pqr'
        Output: 'apbqcr'

    Example 2:
        Input: word1 = 'ab', word2 = 'pqrs'
        Output: 'apbqrs'

    Example 3:
        Input: word1 = 'abcd', word2 = 'pq'
        Output: 'apbqcd'
